[SourceID: Priv-4.3] **Third-party Websites and Services:** Our Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Legora, including social media services ("third-party sites"). The information that you share with third-party sites will be governed by the specific privacy policies and terms of service of the third-party sites and not by this Privacy Policy.

## 5. International Transfers

[SourceID: Priv-5.1] Legora always strives to process your personal data as close to you as possible. By using our Online Services however, you understand and acknowledge that your personal information will be transferred from your location to our facilities and servers in the EU/EEA.

[SourceID: Priv-5.2] In certain situations, such as when we share your information within the Legora corporate group or with a supplier or subcontractor, your personal data may be transferred outside EU/EEA. Legora always ensures that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data according to the relevant data protection laws, even when the data is internationally transferred. Your rights in respect to your personal data (described in detail in section 6), are not affected when data is internationally transferred. You will find more information about the recipients Legora shares your data with in section 4.

### Safety Measures Legora Uses When Conducting International Transfers

[SourceID: Priv-5.3] Countries outside of the EU/EEA or your country of residence may have laws that allow public authorities to request access to personal data stored in the country for the purpose of combating crime or safeguarding national security. Regardless of whether we or any of our providers process your personal data, we will ensure that a high level of protection is guaranteed when transferring that data and that appropriate protection measures have been taken, in accordance with applicable data protection requirements (such as the GDPR).

Such appropriate safeguards include, but are not limited to:

- **Adequacy decisions.** If the relevant authority (e.g. the EU Commission) has decided that the country to which your personal data are transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the relevant data protection laws.
- **Standard Contractual Clauses.** The relevant authority's standard clauses have been entered into between Legora and the recipient of the personal data. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the relevant data protection laws still applies, and that your rights are still protected. In these cases, we also assess whether there are laws in the recipient country that affects the protection of your personal data. Where necessary, we take technical and organizational measures so that your data remain protected during the transfer to the relevant country.
- **Derogation.** In limited circumstances, we may rely on an exception, or 'derogation' under the applicable data protection laws, to transfer your personal data to such country despite the absence of an adequacy decision or standard contractual clauses, such as relying on your explicit consent to that transfer or because it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
- **Data Privacy Framework.** If the transfer is covered by a relevant data privacy framework, such as the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which is an opt-in certification scheme for US companies, administered by the US Department of Commerce. Data privacy framework include sets of enforceable principles and requirements that must be certified to company, ensuring that your data is still being sufficiently protected.

## 6. What Are Your Rights

[SourceID: Priv-6.1] You have several rights under the applicable data protection laws (including the GDPR) related to your control over your personal data and to receive information directly from us on how we process personal data about you. In the following you can read about your rights.

- **Right to information and access.** You have the right to be informed of how we process your personal data. We do this through this Privacy Policy and by answering your questions. You can request information regarding whether we are processing your personal data and ask to receive a copy of your personal data ("data extract"), so called data subject access. Through the data extract you will receive information about what personal data Legora holds about you and how we process it.
- **Right to rectification.** If you believe that your personal data is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to ask for it to be corrected or completed.
- **Right to restriction.** If you believe that your personal data is inaccurate, that our processing is unlawful or that we do not need the information for a specific purpose, you have the right to request that we restrict the processing of such personal data. You also have the possibility to request that we stop processing your personal data while we assess your request. If you object to our processing per your right described directly below, you may also request us to restrict processing of that personal data while we make our assessment.
- **Right to object.** You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data which is based on our legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR), by referencing your personal circumstances. If we cannot demonstrate compelling and legitimate grounds to continue processing the personal data, we must cease the processing. You can also always object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If you do so, we will turn off marketing for you, and stop sending it to you.
- **Right to be forgotten.** In some cases, you have the right to have us delete personal data about you. For example, you can request us to delete personal data that we (i) no longer need for the purpose it was collected for, or (ii) process based on your consent and you revoke your consent. There are situations where Legora is unable to delete your data, for example, when the data is still necessary to process for the purpose for which the data was collected, Legora's interest to process the data overrides your interest in having them deleted, or because we have a legal obligation to keep it.
- **Right to transfer your personal data (data portability).** If we process your personal data to fulfill a contract or on the basis of your consent, you may, in certain cases, be able to obtain the personal data for use elsewhere, e.g. by obtaining a copy of it in a machine-readable format and transmitting it to another data controller.
- **Right to withdraw consent.** In those cases where we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. When you withdraw your consent, we will stop any processing of personal data which is based on your consent.
- **Right to lodge a complaint.** If you have objections or concerns about how we process your personal data, you have the right to contact, or lodge a complaint with, the relevant authority for privacy protection, which is the supervisory authority for our personal data processing.

[SourceID: Priv-6.2] To exercise your rights, please contact us at any time. We reserve the right to limit our facilitating such requests to that which is required by applicable law.

[SourceID: Priv-6.3] In order to protect your personal data from unauthorized access or deletion, we may require you to verify your identity before we will process any request to know or delete personal data. If we cannot verify your identity (and, where applicable, proof of residency) to our satisfaction, we will not provide or delete your personal data. You may submit a request to exercise your rights through an authorized agent. Such an agent must present signed written authority to act on your behalf and must be able to verify your identity (and, where applicable, proof of residency) to our satisfaction.

Rest assured that we will not discriminate against you for making any such request. Your right to access and delete your personal data is important to us, and we will take reasonable steps to verify and process your request promptly.

[SourceID: Priv-6.4] Please be aware that even if we delete your personal data, certain residual data may still remain in our backups or archives for a limited period in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable laws. If you have any questions or concerns about this process or our data deletion practices, please feel free to contact us.

## 7. How Do We Keep Your Personal Data Safe

[SourceID: Priv-7.1] We take significant and appropriate steps to protect your personal data in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information which may include: physical access controls, encryption, intrusion detection and network monitoring depending on the nature of the information and the scope of processing.

For more information regarding our security measures, please view our Security Policy.

## 8. How Long Do We Store Your Personal Data

[SourceID: Priv-8.1] Legora retains your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it or longer if that is required under applicable law:

- If you are a Legora user covered by a Subscription Agreement between your employer and Legora, we will delete your data in accordance with that Subscription Agreement.
- Personal data that Legora is under a legal obligation to retain, for example under anti-money laundering or bookkeeping laws, is retained for the required periods under applicable laws (generally for 5 or 7 years).
- Personal data which is not used for the purposes of a contractual relationship or where Legora does not have a legal obligation to retain the data is only retained as long as necessary to fulfil the respective purpose for our data processing (usually 3 months).

[SourceID: Priv-8.2] More information can be found in the table in Section 3.

[SourceID: Priv-8.3] In some limited cases, the personal data may need to be stored for a longer period in order for Legora to protect its legal rights. If we don't have a legal obligation to retain the personal data, we instead have to make an assessment if we may require the personal data in order to protect Legora from legal claims.

Please note that just because we have a legal obligation to store your personal data, this does not mean that we are also permitted to use this data for any other purpose.

[SourceID: Priv-8.4] When we no longer need your personal data, we will delete it or anonymize it in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable laws, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
