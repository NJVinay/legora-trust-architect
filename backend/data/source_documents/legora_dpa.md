[SourceID: DPA-2.1] Legora undertakes to process Personal Data for purposes set forth in this DPA (including Specification of Data Processing) and in accordance with the Subscriber's written instructions, unless otherwise required by Applicable Data Protection Laws. The Subscriber's instructions to Legora regarding the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of Personal Data and categories of data subjects, and the rights and obligations of both Parties are set forth in this DPA and in Specification of Data Processing.

[SourceID: DPA-2.2] As data processor, Legora undertakes to:
a) Comply with all Applicable Data Protection Laws that are applicable to it as a processor of the Personal Data;
b) Cooperate with audits conducted by the Subscriber; and
c) Inform the Subscriber promptly if Legora determines that an instruction from the Subscriber violates Applicable Data Protection Laws.

[SourceID: DPA-2.3] Any transfer of Personal Data to Legora using the Services shall be made using secure, reasonable, and appropriate mechanisms for data transfers.

[SourceID: DPA-2.4] Legora shall, without undue delay, inform the Subscriber of any communication with any Data Protection Authority that relates to Legora's processing of Personal Data under this DPA, and Legora will provide reasonable assistance to the Subscriber if the Subscriber receives a request from such authority or is subject to a regulatory investigation. In addition, if data subjects, competent authorities or any other third parties request information from Legora regarding the processing of Personal Data covered by this DPA, Legora shall refer such requests to the Subscriber to the extent permissible under applicable law.

[SourceID: DPA-2.5] Legora shall provide reasonable assistance to the Subscriber, through appropriate technical and organizational measures, with the Subscriber's compliance obligations to implement reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the Personal Data.

## 3. Obligations of the Subscriber

[SourceID: DPA-3.1] The Subscriber shall ensure that it has a valid legal basis, and all necessary rights, consents, and authorizations, to provide the Personal Data to Legora and to authorize Legora to process that Personal Data in accordance with this DPA, the Agreement and/or other processing instructions provided by the Subscriber to Legora.

[SourceID: DPA-3.2] The Subscriber shall comply with all Applicable Data Protection Laws that are applicable to it as controller of the Personal Data.

## 4. Sub-processors

[SourceID: DPA-4.1] Legora is, subject to Clause 4.2, and Clause 5 entitled to engage subcontractors acting as sub-processors, and under the condition that they are bound by a written agreement which impose on them materially the same data processing obligations as the obligations under this DPA in respect of data protection.

[SourceID: DPA-4.2] Legora shall inform the Subscriber of any new sub-processors by updating the subprocessor list and give the Subscriber the opportunity to object to such changes. Such objections by the Subscriber shall be based on grounds regarding the new sub-processor's ability to comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws and be made in writing within 30 days from posting. Legora may not engage a new sub-processor before the 30-day period has ended. Legora shall upon request provide the Subscriber with such information available to Legora that the Subscriber may reasonably request to assess the new sub-processor's ability to comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws. If Legora, despite the Subscriber's objection, wishes to engage the sub-processor, the Parties shall in good faith discuss and try to find an alternative solution which is reasonably acceptable to both Parties. If the Parties cannot find an alternative solution and the Subscriber still objects to the appointment of the sub-processor, and if the Subscriber's objection would result in additional costs or expenses for Legora, then Legora is entitled to adjust its fees under the Agreement to ensure that Legora is compensated for such additional and/or increased costs or expenses. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the Subscriber's objection would result in costs or operational consequences which, in Legora's opinion, would not be commercially reasonable, Legora may terminate the Agreement upon reasonable written notice.

## 5. Third Country Transfers

[SourceID: DPA-5.1] The Subscriber acknowledges that it may transfer Personal Data or make Personal Data available by remote access to Legora in the EU, in order for Legora to provide the Services. Legora may not process Personal Data outside or engage sub-processors processing the personal data outside of the EU/EEA (which shall be considered given if the Subscriber has not objected to a new sub-processor within the time set out in Clause 4.2).

[SourceID: DPA-5.2] To the extent any transfer described in Clause 5.1 constitutes a Restricted Transfer, Legora shall upon request provide all reasonably relevant information regarding the Restricted Transfer to enable the Subscriber to make an informed decision, including details of the country or territory to which the Personal Data will be transferred.

[SourceID: DPA-5.3] If Standard Contractual Clauses are used as a Data Transfer Mechanism under this DPA, they shall be implemented as follows:
a) Legora shall ensure that the Restricted Transfer is subject to adequate safeguards as stated in Chapter V of the GDPR and may for this purpose rely on the Standard Contractual Clauses provided that the clauses, including supplementary security measures, ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection.
b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that Legora or its Sub-processor, as applicable, shall apply module 3 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

[SourceID: DPA-5.4] Legora represents and warrants that Legora has no reason to believe that legislation or practices applicable to it or its sub-processors, including in any country to which Personal Data is transferred either by itself or through a sub-processor, prevents it from fulfilling its obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws, this DPA or its obligations in the Standard Contractual Clauses. In the event Legora is unable to fulfil its obligations in this Clause 5.4, Legora agrees to immediately notify the Subscriber.

## 6. Information Security and Confidentiality

## 9. Audit Rights

[SourceID: DPA-9.1] Subscriber shall have the right to perform audits of Legora's processing of Subscriber's personal data to verify Legora's compliance with this DPA and Applicable Data Protection Laws.

[SourceID: DPA-9.2] Legora undertakes to make available to the Subscriber all information and other assistance necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this DPA and allow for and contribute to audits, including on-site inspections, conducted by an authorized and reputable auditor mandated by the Subscriber, provided that the individuals performing the audits enter into confidentiality agreements or are bound by statutory obligations of confidentiality.

[SourceID: DPA-9.3] In this context, it is noted that among Legora's customers there may be entities which are subject to statutory and/or bar association rules on confidentiality in relation to client/customer matters (e.g. banks, financial institutions, law firms, etc.). Hence, the Subscriber acknowledges that audits under this DPA shall not include access to information pertaining or belonging to Legora's other customers.

[SourceID: DPA-9.4] The Subscriber is responsible for all costs associated with audits, save for when an audit concludes a material breach of Legora's undertakings in violation of the Agreement. If so, Legora shall compensate the Subscriber for reasonable and verified costs associated with the audit.
